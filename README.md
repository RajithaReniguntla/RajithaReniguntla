## Hi there, I'm Raji 👋

I'm a **supply chain enthusiast** and a **third-culture kid**  — someone who’s lived between worlds and now tries to **make sense of the world through data**.
I love uncovering the story behind the numbers.

### 🔍 What I'm Exploring Right Now:
- Supply chain optimization using **Python**

### 🔍 What I Do:

- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Building dashboards using **Power BI**, **Excel**, and use **Python** & **R** for data analysis  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Experienced with **Power Query**, **SQL**, and **pandas** for reshaping messy datasets  
- **Insights from Public Data**: Most of my projects leverage open datasets from sources like the **World Bank**, **WHO**, and **UN**  
- **Fraud Detection & Risk Analysis**: Applied classification models and SMOTE to improve fraud prediction  
- **Storytelling with Data**: Focused on making dashboards not just informative, but intuitive for non-technical audiences

### 🛠️ What I've Worked On:
- Building **data narratives** using **Power BI**, **R**, and **Python** — transforming raw data into visuals that help non-technical users engage with insights and take action  
- Exploring public datasets on **education, gender equity,** and **labor force dynamics**, and even diving into **NBA data** for a little sports analytics on the side

### 💡 What I Care About:
- Using data to solve *real-world* problems — from global logistics to public policy, connecting analytics to impact!
- Making insights accessible through clean visuals, smart questions, and practical storytelling
