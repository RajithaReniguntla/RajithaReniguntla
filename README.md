## Hi there, I'm Raji 👋

I'm a supply chain enthusiast with a background in data analytics. As a third-culture kid, I’ve spent my life navigating between different worlds — now, I bring that perspective to data, digging deep to uncover the stories and insights behind the numbers.

### 🔍 What I'm Exploring Right Now:
- Supply chain optimization using **Python** (using PuLP)

---

### 🔍 What I Do:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Skilled in reshaping messy datasets using Python (pandas, numpy), Power Query, and SQL
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Building dashboards using Power BI, Excel, and use Python & R for data analysis   
- **Reporting**: I focus on building reports and dashboards that make sense to everyone, not just the data team
